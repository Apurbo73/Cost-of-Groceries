### Cost of Groceries

### Explanation:
For each test case, we read N and X.

We read the freshness values into the vector freshness.

We read the costs into the vector cost.

We then iterate through all items, adding the cost to totalCost only if the freshness is greater than or equal to X.

Finally, we output the total cost.
